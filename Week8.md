**Hypothesis:**
I hypothesise that integrating spaced repetition techniques into my study routine for learning Content Management Systems (CMS) through LinkedIn Learning videos will result in better retention compared to traditional methods.

**Background:**
Spaced repetition is a proven learning strategy that involves reviewing material at increasing intervals over time. This method capitalises on the spacing effect, which suggests that information is better retained when revisited multiple times with expanding intervals between each review session.

**Test:**
1. **Material Selection:** Choose a topic related to Content Management Systems (CMS) from LinkedIn Learning videos.
2. **Study Plan:** Divide the video content into manageable segments and create flashcards or use a spaced repetition app (like Anki) to input key information.
3. **Control Group:** Study one section of the content using traditional methods, such as watching the videos once and taking notes.
4. **Experimental Group:** Study another section of the content using spaced repetition techniques. Review the flashcards or utilise a spaced repetition app according to a predetermined schedule.
5. **Assessment:** After a week of studying both sections, test yourself on the material. This could involve quizzes, explaining concepts to someone else, or applying the knowledge in practical tasks.
6. **Analysis:** Compare the performance and retention of the material studied using spaced repetition with that of the traditionally studied material. Analyse the recall and understanding levels of both groups.
7. **Reflection:** Reflect on the effectiveness of spaced repetition for learning the chosen CMS content and draw conclusions based on the results.

**Learning Activities:**
For this experiment, I chose a series of LinkedIn Learning videos focusing on Content Management Systems (CMS). I divided the content into smaller segments and created flashcards for key concepts, tools, and techniques discussed in the videos.

For the control group, I watched one section of the videos using traditional methods: viewing the content once and taking detailed notes.

For the experimental group, I studied another section of the videos using spaced repetition techniques. I inputted important information into a spaced repetition app and reviewed the flashcards daily according to the app's suggested schedule.

After a week of studying both sections, I tested myself on the material by completing quizzes and explaining concepts to a study partner.

**Results:**
Upon analysing the results, it was evident that the retention of the material studied using spaced repetition was significantly better compared to the material studied using traditional methods. The experimental group demonstrated higher recall and understanding levels, with less forgetting over time compared to the control group.

**Learning Insights:**
This experiment provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of spaced repetition for learning Content Management Systems content from LinkedIn Learning videos. Integrating spaced repetition techniques into my study routine proved to be a powerful strategy for improving retention and long-term recall. Moving forward, I intend to continue leveraging spaced repetition in my learning endeavours and explore further ways to optimise its application for different subjects and learning materials.
